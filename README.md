# Pascal-Compiler
Compiler written in C++ that implementes the core features of the Pascal programming language.

## Getting Started
In order to use this compiler there are two projects the compiler and the assembly. Write the code you want compiled in code.txt. After you have written your code you will run the Compiler project which will compile your pascal code into x86 assembly. Any sytnax or compilation errors found will be displayed in stdout. Once compiled you can run the assembly project which will run your newly compiled code.
